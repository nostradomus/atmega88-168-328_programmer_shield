## What

This repo provides you with all necessary info (and files) to build an Arduino shield to program [Atmel](http://www.atmel.com)'s **[atmega88/168/328](http://www.microchip.com/design-centers/8-bit/microchip-avr-mcus)** ùúá-controllers. For that matter, the underlying Arduino board should be loaded with the [ISP-programmer sketch](source/ArduinoISP.ino) (built-in example). Two versions have been included. All images in the description below, refer to the 16MHz version with an external crystal oscillator. An alternative (minimalistic) version is also available in all respective sub-folders (marked as 'minimal'). It concerns a shield to program the same ¬µ-controllers using their 8MHz internal clock.

## Why

After having tested one of your new marvelous ideas with an existing eco-system, a lot of airwires and a piece of breadboard, you will probably start designing a state-of-the-art custom pcb to finalize the building of your project. During such a design phase, I however got tired of wiring up the ISPC connector over-and-over-again. As (like many people) I was having a spare UNO, which could serve as an [in-circuit serial programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-system_programming), I decided to design a minimalistic shield to fit on top of it.  

## How

The shield has been designed with EAGLE from AutoDesk/CadSoft. This shield [project](eagle-files/) can be opened with the free version [(download here)](http://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download). Only [through-hole components](BOM.md) have been used in order to make the build also feasible for any junior electronics enthusiast. In the [pdf-folder](pdf-files/) of this repo pdf versions of all important EAGLE views are available, for those not wanting to install EAGLE. Pay attention to print the bottom and top-layer layouts **without re-sizing** (1:1). To have the printed circuit board built by a commercial PCB-shop, the full  [gerber-files](gerber-files/) are also available. When etching the board at home, don't forget to add the vias, or solder pieces of wire from solder to component side.

## Technical details

### What‚Äôs on the board

The board has been fit with a narrow 28-pin [ZIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_insertion_force) socket, which is wired up to be universal for several types of AVR's. On the boarder of the PCB, pin headers with double functionality have been mounted. Pins on the bottom-side to fit on the Arduino board, and feed-through female headers on the top for easy access of all Arduino connections.
The push button, is connected to the reset lines of the [AVR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmel_AVR) in the ZIF socket (and the ICSP on the shield) with a 10kŒ© pull-up resistor. When the shield is cut correctly, the reset button for the underlying Arduino UNO should still be accessible. In order to make the Arduino Uno work as an ISP programmer a 10¬µF capacitor needs to be connected on its reset-line.
Three LED‚Äôs are available to visualize the correct functionality of the programming procedure.
An optional AVR ISP connector has been foreseen in order to use the shield as stand-alone with a commercial programmer.

### How things work

First the the [ISP-programmer sketch](sketches/ArduinoISP.ino) (built-in example) should be loaded to the Arduino UNO board. During that operation, switch S2 should be set to "RUN". Select ‚ÄúArduino Uno‚Äù as target board in the tools-menu. Load the ISP-programmer sketch with the ‚ÄúUPLOAD‚Äù button. Once loaded, switch S2 can be set to "PROG" to send a sketch to the atmega ùúá-controller in the ZIF socket.

![ISP example sketch](images/menu_File-Examples.png) ![Board selection](images/menu_Tools-Board.png) ![Upload](images/menu_Sketch-Upload.png)

To load a sketch to your atmega ùúá-controller in the ZIF socket, make sure that the correct target board is selected in the tools-menu (you might need to download a specific library -> tools-menu, board manager). This time, use the ‚ÄúUPLOAD USING PROGRAMMER‚Äù option from the sketch-menu.

![Programmer selection](images/menu_Tools-Programmer.png) ![Upload Using Programmer](images/menu_Sketch-Upload_Using_Programmer.png)

When using the "8MHz internal clock" shield, an [adapted board configuration](source/minimal-boards.zip) should be used (read "fuse-settings"), which can be found in the [source-folder](source/). Other versions can be found on the [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoToBreadboard) (see paragraph on minimal hardware). To install this package driver, create a "hardware" folder in the Arduino sketches folder on your computer (path to be found in the Arduino preferences),

![Preferences window](images/menu_Arduino-Preferences.png)

and copy the unzipped [package archive](source/minimal-boards.zip) in there.

![Arduino sketches folder](images/finder_Arduino-SketchesFolder-Hardware.png)

Next restart the Arduino IDE, and the required board will appear in your board's list.

![Board selection](images/menu_Tools-Board-internalclock.png) ![Minimal board in the board selector menu](images/menu_Tools-Board-detail.png)

When loading a new sketch to the target ¬µ-controller, the 3 LED‚Äôs will tell you how things are going :
 - Green  : **ICSP programmer running** (fading LED means 'idle')
 - Yellow : **uploading sketch** (programming code is being uploaded)
 - Red    : **Error!** (oops, something went wrong during the upload)

### Proof of concept

So far, I have tested the shield with the below list of ùúá-controllers :
- atmega168
- atmega328

 Programming shield should also function correctly for other pin-compatible ¬µ-controllers, such as :
 - atmega88
